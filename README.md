# Topic Modeling
**Defination**
> Topic modeling is a technique used in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to discover abstract "topics" or themes within a large collection of textual data. It is an unsupervised learning method, meaning it doesn't require labeled data for training. The primary goal of topic modeling is to extract the main topics present in a corpus of text documents without any prior knowledge about what those topics might be.
